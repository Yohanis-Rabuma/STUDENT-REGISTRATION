   - Typically, files should be uploaded to the `public_html` folder (or similar).

   **Step 4: Create a MySQL Database**
   - Log in to your web hosting control panel (cPanel or equivalent).
   - Find the Database section and create a new MySQL database.
   - Create a database user and assign it to the database with all privileges.

   - Rename it to `wp-config.php`.
   - Open it and enter your database name, username, and password.

   **Step 6: Run the Installation Script**
   - Open a web browser and go to `http://yourdomain.com/wp-admin/install.php`.

   **Step 7: Log in to WordPress Dashboard**
   - Go to `http://yourdomain.com/wp-admin` and log in using the credentials you created.
   - Start building your website!
